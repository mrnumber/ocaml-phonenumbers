(* Checks whether a phone number is a possible number. It provides a more
   lenient check than IsValidNumber() in the following sense:
     1. It only checks the length of phone numbers. In particular, it doesn't
        check starting digits of the number.
     2. It doesn't attempt to figure out the type of the number, but uses
        general rules which applies to all types of phone numbers in a
        region. Therefore, it is much faster than IsValidNumber().
     3. For fixed line numbers, many regions have the concept of area code,
        which together with subscriber number constitute the national
        significant number. It is sometimes okay to dial the subscriber
        number only when dialing in the same area. This function will return

        hand, because IsValidNumber() validates using information on both
        starting digits (for fixed line numbers, that would most likely be
        area codes) and length (obviously includes the length of area codes
        for fixed line numbers), it will return false for the

   it is written as 00 1 650 253 0000, it could be dialed from any region
   which uses an international dialling prefix of 00. When it is written as
   650 253 0000, it could only be dialed from within the US, and when written
